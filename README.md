# discriminant
discriminant search

I wrote this code for a reason: "JUST LIKE THAT." 
thanks to it, you will be able to find a discriminant from any quadratic function.
Of course, I understand that this action can be done using different modules, however,
I decided to implement this topic myself for training purposes.
